# Diamond Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview

This README documents the exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on the diamond dataset using Python libraries including Seaborn, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The analysis was conducted in Google Colab and focuses on visualizing relationships between various diamond attributes.

## Dataset Description

The diamond dataset contains information about diamonds with the following key attributes:
- **carat**: Weight of the diamond
- **cut**: Quality of the cut
- **color**: Diamond color grade
- **clarity**: Clarity grade of the diamond
- **price**: Price in USD

## Analysis Methods

The following EDA techniques were applied to understand the dataset:

1. Data loading and initial exploration
2. Visualization of relationships between diamond attributes using various plot types:
   - Box plots and violin plots (sns.boxplot, sns.violinplot) to examine price distribution across categorical variables
   - Heatmaps (sns.heatmap) to analyze correlations between numerical variables
   - Scatter plots (sns.lmplot) to visualize relationships between carat weight, color, and price

## Key Visualizations

1. Distribution of diamond prices across different categories
2. Correlation between diamond attributes (particularly carat weight and price)
3. How color and clarity grades affect diamond pricing
4. Scatter plots showing the relationship between carat weight and price, with color as a secondary variable

## Usage

This analysis serves as a demonstration of data visualization techniques for exploring relationships in diamond pricing and characteristics. The code and methodology can be adapted for similar datasets or extended for more advanced analysis.
